# Ant-GDX
[Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) cellular automaton implemented in [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). The rules of Langton's ant is as follows:

* The world is made up of a grid of cells
* A cell can either be on or off
* If the ant is on an on cell it turns it off and turns left
* If the ant is off an on cell it turns it on and turns right
